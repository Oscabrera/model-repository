## Creating Request resources and the authorize method

Laravel's `make:request` command is a useful tool for quickly creating request
classes for API routes. However, when using this command, the `authorize` method
within the request class will return a value of `false` by default.
This means that any request that uses that request class will be automatically
denied.

## Allow access to resources:

To allow access to resources protected by the authorize method, there are two options:

1. Change the return value of the authorize method to true:

This is the simplest way to allow access to all users. However, it is not recommended as it completely removes the
authorization layer.

authorize method to true example:

```php
public function authorize()
{
    return true;
}
```

2. Define the authorization rules within the authorize method:

This is best practice for controlling access to resources on a granular basis. You can use the Gate facade to define
authorization rules based on roles, permissions, or any other custom logic.

### Additional Tips:

It is important to define specific and relevant authorization rules for each resource.
Roles and permissions can be used to simplify authorization management.
It is advisable to document authorization rules clearly and concisely.
I hope this information helps you better understand how the authorize method works and how you can use it to control
access to your resources.
