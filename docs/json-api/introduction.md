# Endpoint Responses

Endpoint responses generated by this package adhere to JSON:API format, which ensures that data is structured and
transmitted in a consistent and standardized manner.

## Integration with JSON

No additional configuration is required to get this benefit as
the [json-api-format-paginate](https://oscabrera.github.io/laravel-json-api-format-paginate) package is built in for
this purpose. This package makes it easy to paginate and format responses according to JSON specifications, providing a
smoother and more coherent development experience.

## Benefits

- **Standardization**: Adherence to the JSON format ensures that responses are consistent with standard expectations,
  facilitating interoperability with other services and clients that support JSON:API
- **Ease of Use**: Since the [json-api-format-paginate](https://oscabrera.github.io/laravel-json-api-format-paginate)
  package is integrated, manual configurations are minimized, allowing rapid implementation and reduction of errors.
- **Clear Documentation**: Using JSON:API

makes endpoint documentation and consumption clearer and more understandable for developers familiar with this standard.
