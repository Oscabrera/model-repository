This package for Laravel greatly simplifies the process of creating a complete RESTful API for any model in your
application. By just running a command, you can generate all the files necessary to create, read, update and delete
instances of said model. This project is based on the Repository pattern, separating data access logic from business
logic, resulting in cleaner, more modular and easier to maintain code. In addition, it integrates services that manage
the business logic and serve to orchestrate operations on the repository, thus providing an additional layer of
abstraction and organization to the code.
